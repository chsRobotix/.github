Welcome to the GitHub page of FTC Team 6406, FIRST Tech Coyotes!
This is where we keep repositories of our code each season. You can see some of our previous years' code if you go to repositories and clicked on "[Archived](https://github.com/orgs/chsRobotix/repositories?type=archived)."

To join the Robotix Team, please contact one of the organization owners. GitHub only allows users to join organizations by invitation, so when sending a message, please include your GitHub username.
